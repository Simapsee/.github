To get started, please create a GitHub account if you do not have one already and let us know your GitHub username so that we can add you as a collaborator to our repository.

## GitHub Project Board

We use the GitHub project board to manage our tasks and track the progress of our development. To access the project board, go to https://github.com/simapsee/simapsee/projects. Our board is organized into several columns:

- **To Do**: This is where we keep all of the tasks that need to be done. These tasks may include bug fixes, new features, or improvements to existing features.
- **In Progress**: This is where we move tasks that are currently being worked on.
- **Review**: This is where we move tasks that are ready for review by other team members.
- **Done**: This is where we move tasks that have been completed.

To get started, find your team's board on the project board and look for the issue that you have been assigned to. If you are unsure about which issue you should be working on, please reach out to your team leader or manager for guidance.



We look forward to working with you and helping you achieve your goals at Simapsee. Welcome aboard!
