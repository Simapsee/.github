We combine the power of computer simulation, mapping technology, and self-reflection to provide personalized solutions to help individuals break free from unhealthy habits and reach their full potential.

## Inspiration
The name SIMAPSEE was derived from three words: Synapse, Simulation, and Map. Synapses refer to the points of contact between neurons, where information is passed from one neuron to the next. Simulation refers to the production of a computer model of something, especially for the purpose of study. Map refers to a diagrammatic representation of an area of land or sea showing physical features, cities, roads, etc. Combining these words, we came up with SIMAPSEE - simulating a map to see your higher self.
