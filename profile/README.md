# SIMAPSEE - See Your Higher Self

Our aim is to equip individuals with the tools they need to consciously and consistently visualize their higher selves, leading to a gradual unraveling of that reality through their own actions.

## Product Description

Our first product will include:

- Audible and visual tools for seeing your higher self
- Personalized actualization pills through a well-documented open-label placebo trial/experiment

## Problem

SIMAPSEE is addressing the problem of a lack of consistent visualization and action towards achieving one's higher self. Many individuals struggle to maintain the motivation and accountability necessary to make meaningful changes in their lives, especially when it comes to achieving their higher self.

## Solution

Our product provides users with audible and visual tools for seeing their higher self, paired with personalized actualization pills, to create a tangible and achievable path towards self-improvement. Our solution is focused on reprogramming the subconscious mind, rather than telling people what specific actions to take. While setting goals can be helpful, we believe that achieving one's higher self requires feeding the conscious mind with positive material and allowing the subconscious mind to drive people's actions. With our app, users will be able to input their goals and receive personalized affirmations and auto-suggestions to help them achieve those goals. By doing so, we aim to empower individuals to take charge of their growth and achieve their full potential using an evidence-based approach to achieving their goals.

## How We Are Different

SIMAPSEE is different from other self-improvement products because it combines personalized actualization pills through a well-documented open-label placebo trial with audible and visual tools for seeing one's higher self. This combination of AI tools, affirmations, and placebo pills creates an innovative and unique approach to self-improvement that has not been done before on a mass scale. Additionally, our app fosters accountability and growth among users seeking an edge towards their higher self.

# Project Board/Codespace

GitHub is our official project management and codespace platform. To get started, please create a GitHub account if you do not have one already and let us know your GitHub username so that we can add you as a collaborator to our repository.

## GitHub Project Board

We use the GitHub project board to manage our tasks and track the progress of our development, including non-code related projects. To access the project board, go to https://github.com/simapsee/simapsee/projects. Our board is organized into several columns:

- **To Do**: This is where we keep all of the tasks that need to be done. These tasks may include bug fixes, new features, or improvements to existing features, as well as creative and wellness tasks.
- **In Progress**: This is where we move tasks that are currently being worked on.
- **Review**: This is where we move tasks that are ready for review by other team members.
- **Done**: This is where we move tasks that have been completed.

To get started, find your team's board on the project board and look for the issue that you have been assigned to. If you are unsure about which issue you should be working on, please reach out to your team leader or manager for guidance.

### Completing Tasks on the Project Board

Once you have identified the issue you will be working on, read the issue description and requirements carefully. If you have any questions or need clarification, please comment on the issue or reach out to your team leader or manager.

Next, move the issue from the "To Do" column to the "In Progress" column. This will let other team members know that you are working on the issue. If you encounter any issues or obstacles while working on the issue, please comment on the issue or reach out to your team leader or manager for assistance.

When you have completed the task based on the requirements, move the issue to the "Review" column. Other team members will review your work and provide feedback. If there are any changes or improvements that need to be made, you will be notified in the comments section of the issue.

Finally, once the issue has been approved, move it to the "Done" column. Congratulations, you have successfully completed a task on our project board!

We recommend that you regularly check the project board for updates and new tasks. If you see a task that you think you can contribute to, please comment on the issue and let us know that you would like to work on it.

Please see below for team-specific onboarding. If you have any questions or if there is anything we can do to help you get started, please don't hesitate to reach out to your team leader or manager.
